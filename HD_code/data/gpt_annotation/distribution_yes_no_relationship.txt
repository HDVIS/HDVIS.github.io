(b) stochastic simulation of transcription based on the model in (a) generates different simulated clouds (i–v) from different pre-set distributions of burst size and frequency (from i, where genes vary predominantly in burst size, to v, where genes vary predominantly in burst frequency, with equal contributions of size and frequency in iii). in (ii)–(iv), where both size and frequency contribute more equally, simulated data more closely resemble the experimental data. (c) intuitive explanation of how controlling the burst parameters affects the variance of up- and downregulated genes. (i) schematic shows mean expression is increased by increasing either burst size or frequency. (ii) noise increases with burst size and decreases with burst frequency. (iii) restricting the range of possible sizes and frequencies means the gene can only sample a limited range of values of mean and noise. in the example shown, the gene is mainly regulated via frequency, so an increase in expression favors a decrease in noise.']. Reference sentences:[we performed simulations with different ratios of burst size variance and burst frequency vari- ance to the total variance in the system (figure 3b).the most realistic versions of the simulation occurred with strong contributions of both size and frequency to transcript level (figure 3b ii–iv).starting intuitively transcript levels can be increased by increasing burst size frequency or both so expression in- creases along the diagonal of a plot of frequency versus size (figure 3c i).for example if genes are regulated predomi- nantly by burst frequency (box in figure 3c iii) then this will reduce the variance of the transcript abundance during upregulation.to test this reasoning we simulated the changing level of expression of a gene between two developmental time points by randomly sampling pairs of points from the simulated cloud of genes in figure 3b (iii).if regulation was equal between size and frequency the simulation showed no dif- ference in variance between high- and low-expressed genes of a pair (figure 3d ii).if regulation was dominated by burst size the low-expressed partners showed lower variance than the high- expressed partners (figure 3d i).in contrast regulation domi- nated by burst frequency showed that the low-expressed partners had more variability than the high-expressed partners (figure 3d iii).if burst frequency is the dominant source of regulation (figure 3d iii) we would expect that downregulated genes would be more variable.if we consider the low-expressed partner in figure 3d (iii) as the gene that will be upregulated by an increase in burst frequency and the high-expressed versions as the genes that will be downregulated by a decrease in burst frequency we would expect that in undifferentiated cells (0 hr) the genes that will later be upregulated would initially be more variable.generating the simulated gene clouds in figure 3b divided this variance between s2(l) and s2(kon) in the aforementioned ratios- for example for the 50:50 split the sds for both l and kon were 1.91 and 1.912 = 3.65 = 7.3/2 (half the total variance).]

Reference sentences:[we isolated cells into methyl- transferase reaction mixtures using facs followed by the phy- sical separation of the dna and rna prior to bs-seq and rna- seq library preparation (see fig 1a for an illustration of the protocol).however despite this a large proportion of genomic loci with regulatory roles such as promoters and enhancers can in principle be assessed by scnmt-seq (fig 1b).consistent with this we observed high empirical coverage for methylation: a median of ~50% of promoters ~75% of gene bodies and ~25% of active enhancers are captured in a typical cell by at least 5 cytosines (fig 1c supplementary fig 1a).we also compared the methylation coverage to data from our previous bs-seq protocols that did not incorporate a dna accessibility component3 again finding only small differences in coverage albeit these became more pronounced when down-sampling the total sequence coverage (supplementary fig 1b).due to the higher frequency of gpc compared to cpg dinucleotides in the mouse genome accessibility coverage was larger than that observed for endogenous methylation (fig 1b c and supplementary fig 1a).we found that accessibility was increased at known dnasei hypersensitivity sites super enhancer regions and binding sites for transcription factors and other dna binding proteins (from published chip-seq data fig 1d supplementary fig 2).in agreement with previous studies8 we observed that highly-expressed genes were associated with increased accessibility at promoters and at nearby regulatory sites whereas lowly-expressed genes were associated with reduced accessibility (fig 1e; supplementary fig 4).a notable difference was that scnmt-seq data captured within single cells oscillating profiles with peaks spaced ~180 to ~200 bp apart indicating the positions of nucleosomes (fig 1d e and supplementary fig 8) which is consistent with accessibility profiles obtained using bulk nome-seq11 demonstrating high resolution of our accessibility measurements.conversely variability in accessibility rates was either at similar levels to the background or in the case of promoters cgis active enhancers and gene bodies found to be reduced relative to the background (supplementary fig 10c d).first considering associations between methylation and transcription we identified a minimum of 3 (exons) and a maximum of 47 (gene bodies) associations (fdr <0.1 fig 3a supplementary fig 11a supplementary data 2 methods).in contrast we found that associations between dna accessibility and transcription were less widespread with a small number of mostly positive associations in promoters p300 binding sites and super enhancer regions (13 associations total fdr <0.1 fig 3a supplementary fig 11b and supplementary data 2).finally for methylation-accessibility we found associations at most genomic contexts with up to 89 significant correlations (introns) and these tended to be negative as expected (fig 3a supplementary fig 11c and supplementary data 2).similarly supplementary fig 12 shows the prtg locus a known neuroectoderm marker21 which is expressed primarily in differentiated cells (supplemen- tary fig 9) again showing marked epigenetic differences between the two cell populations.inspection of accessibility data at the single gpc level reveals complex patterns due to presence of nucleosomes (fig 1d e) which are not appropriately captured by rate parameters calculated in pre- defined windows.as expected the single-cell profiles at gene promoters were more predictive of gene expression than conventional accessibility rates (supple- mentary fig 13) and these captured characteristic patterns of nucleosome depleted regions at transcription start sites and cell- to-cell variation in both the position and the number of nucleo- somes (see supplementary fig 14).examples of genes with a single cluster are shown in supplementary fig 15 and examples of genes with two differentially expressed clusters are shown in supplementary fig 16.the increased bivalency was independent of the mean expression level of the gene (supplementary fig 17).we then tested for coordinated changes between the accessibility profiles and the cellular position in the differentiation trajectory which identified a set of 15 genes that showed a coherent dynamic pattern (supplementary fig 18 methods).supplementary fig 19 shows additional examples of genes with associations between accessibility profile and pseudotime trajectory.accessibility profiles were constructed within each cell and gene in +/–200 bp windows around the tss (as displayed in fig 5b and supplementary fig 14 15 and 16) using a generalised linear model (glm) of basis function regression coupled with a bernoulli likelihood using bprmeth22.to measure the accuracy of the model we computed the pearson’s correlation coef- ficient between the observed and predicted expression levels (supplementary fig 13a) to account for the different number of features used in the two models (i.e. rate vs profile features) we also computed the adjusted r2 (supplementary fig 13b) correlation analysis.]

which are also known as copy number variants) (range 7–99%) were discordant (extended data fig 1c–e).indeed a median of 22% of the genome was esti- mated to be affected by subclonal events across 916 ccle cell lines (extended data fig 1f) suggesting that changes in subclonal compo- sition may underlie the observed differences.genetic variation across 27 mcf7 strains we performed extensive genomic characterization of 27 versions (hereafter called ‘strains’) of the commonly used oestrogen receptor (er)-positive breast cancer cell line mcf712–14 (methods extended data fig 1g–n 2a b and supplementary table 2) including 19 strains that had not undergone drug treatment or genetic manipu- lation 7 strains that carried a genetic modification generally consid- ered to be neutral (for example introduction of a reporter gene cas9 or a dna barcode) and one strain (mcf7-m) that had been expanded in vivo in mice following anti-oestrogen therapy.of these changes 7% of gains and 13% of losses were detected in only a single strain and the remaining events were observed variably across strains (fig 1b and 1broad institute of harvard and mit cambridge ma usa.for example pten was deleted in 17 strains and retained in the other 10 (fig 1c).similarly the oestrogen receptor gene esr1 was gained in 12 strains lost in 6 and unaltered in 9 (fig 1c) and this correlated with differential expres- sion of erα (p = 0.009; extended data fig 3b c and supplementary discussion).only 35% of 95 non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (snvs) and indels that affected the coding sequence or splice regions were shared by all strains: 29% were unique to a single strain and the remaining were present in a subset of strains (fig 1d e extended data fig 3dj supplementary tables 5 6 and supplementary discussion).for example strain m which had been subjected to in vivo passaging and drug treatment was the most genetically distinct; the 11 strains used by the connectivity map project16 over a 10-year period clustered tightly together; and sibling strains d and e which were only a few passages apart were the closest to each other (fig 1f g and extended data fig 3g).the genetic distance between strains appeared to be affected more by passage number and genetic manipulation than by freeze–thaw cycles (fig 1h and extended data fig 4).notably the 27 strains clustered similarly in the space of mutations and expression profiles and the expected downstream consequences of genetic mutations were observed in the gene expression variation (fig 1f g 3b–g extended data fig 6e–i and supplementary table 14).colours as in fig 1.however at least one strain was entirely resistant (<20% growth inhibition) to 48 out of these 55 (87%) active compounds (fig 4a b and extended data fig 10a).the same phenomenon was observed at a more stringent threshold: of 42 compounds with strong activity in at least two strains 33 (79%) were inactive in at least two strains (extended data fig 10b–d j and supplementary discussion).all 33 differentially active compounds were validated in an eight-point dose–response analysis of each of the 27 strains (median spearman’s ρ = 0.42 between screens p = 3 × 10−9; extended data fig 10k supplementary table 27 and supplementary discussion).first replicate treatments yielded highly concordant results (median pearson’s r = 0.97 p < 2 × 10−16; extended data fig 10l).for example the same activity pattern was observed for three proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib mg-132 and carfilzomib; fig 4d) and was associated with bio- chemically measured differential proteasome activity (extended data fig 10m–o).third for 82% of differentially active compounds we found differential gene expression signatures of the mechanism of action27 of the compounds between sensitive and insensitive strains (p = 2 × 10−5; fig 4e–h extended data fig 10p–u and supplementary tables 28 29).for example strains sensitive to cdk inhibitors had an upregulated cell cycle signature and strains sensitive to pi3k inhibitors had an upregulated mtor signature (fig 4f g and extended data fig 10p q).notably the strains that were the most resistant to treatment in general (strains m and q) showed downregulation of drug metabolism pathways (extended data fig 10v).for example genetic inactivation of pten was associated with decreased pten and increased akt expression signatures (fig 1c e 3e f) and increased sensitivity to the akt inhibitor iv (fig 4h i).similarly esr1 loss was associated with reduced oestrogen signalling (fig 1c 3g) which was in turn associated with reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen or oestrogen depletion (fig 4j and extended data fig 10w–x).more broadly clustering of the mcf7 strains based on their drug response was highly similar to clustering based on genetics or gene expression (fig 1g 2a 3b 4a extended data fig 11a and supplementary discussion).genome-wide crispr screens showed that genetic dependencies were affected by genomic variation similar to pharmacological dependencies (extended data fig 11b–f supplementary table 31 and supplementary discussion) and functional analyses revealed that single-cell-derived clones remained g early oestrogen response esr1 loss (n = 6) vs others (n = 21) –0.45 0 p < 0.001 q < 0.001 0 0.5 mtor signaling f ptenmut (n = 13) vs others (n = 14) p < 0.001 q < 0.001 rank 0 0.35 e mtor signaling pten del (n = 17) vs others (n = 10) p < 0.001 q < 0.006 enrichment score –0.4 –0.2 0 enrichment score chr.colours as in fig 1. c schematics of the analysis performed to evaluate the association between genetic variation and transcriptional programs.article research phenotypically unstable (extended data fig 11g–i and supplementary discussion).colours as in fig 1.cell line diversification can therefore be estimated using inexpensive profiling methods (extended data fig 11j).to implement the force-directed layout described in extended data fig 11b the full corrected dependency matrix was reduced to its top 100 principle components and a k-means clustering algorithm was run repeatedly on cell lines.article research extended data fig 1 | comparison of broad and sanger genomic features across 106 cell lines.for gel source data see supplementary fig 1.groups of strains expected to cluster together based on their evolutionary history are highlighted as in fig 1.groups of strains expected to cluster together based on their evolutionary history are highlighted as in fig 1.groups of strains expected to cluster together based on their evolutionary history are highlighted as in fig 1.article research extended data fig 10 | see next page for caption.article research extended data fig 10 | characterization of drug-response variation across 27 mcf7 strains.groups of strains expected to cluster together based on their evolutionary history are highlighted as in fig 1. b pie chart of the classification of the screened compounds based on their differential activity.for gel source data see supplementary fig 1. o quantification of the relative expression of psmc2 and psmd1.article research extended data fig 11 | see next page for caption.article research extended data fig 11 | comparison of genetic- transcriptomic- and drug-response-based clustering trees genomic distances and crispr dependencies.]

in cd34+cd38− hspcs compared to cd34+cd38+ progenitors (p = 0.02 wilcoxon rank-sum test) (fig 1j).the standard 10x genomics chromium 3′ (v.2 or v.3 chemistry) and 5′ libraries were carried out according to the manufacturer’s recommendations until after emulsion breakage and recovery of first strand cdna (fig 1a step 1).for 3′ libraries if the targeted gene of interest (for example sf3b1) was not robustly detected by the stand- ard 10x procedure (that is if <60% of the expected cells showed expression) on the basis of a priori knowledge in a similar dataset a gene-specific primer was spiked into 10x primer mix at 1% of the concentration of the cdna amplification primers for the initial cdna pcr step (fig 1a; see supplementary table 5 for list of primers and extended data fig 1b c for primer positions).after clean-up locus-specific reverse primers and generic forward sample index (si)-pcr oligonucleotide (10x genomics) were used to amplify the site of interest of the cdna template (extended data fig 1b c supplementary table 5).the si-pcr oligonucleotide anneals to the partial illumina read 1 sequence at the 3′ or 5′ end of the molecule when using 3′ or 5′ libraries respectively which preserves the cell barcode and umi (extended data fig 1b c).1: agacugaccuctacacgacgctcttccgatct (extended data fig 1b c supplementary table 5).2 (extended data fig 1b c supplementary table 5).the genomic region of interest for gen- otyping was examined to determine how many umis with the targeted sequence were present in the conventional 10x data (fig 1c extended data fig 3a b).we identified 19 distinct clusters in the integrated data for samples et01–et05 which were annotated according to previously identified marker genes26 (t-sne in fig 1d and clustering heat map and t-sne with representative marker genes in extended data fig 4b c).for mutant-frequency analysis between hspcs and mkps (fig 1g) genotype status was defined as the fixed effect and as random effects we used intercepts for individual patients (subjects) and iterative downsampling.for inte- grated analysis of pseudotime comparisons (fig 1i) and gene-module expression (for example fig 3c) genotype status was entered as the fixed effect and subjects as random effects.subsequently for reads that passed the priming step the corresponding read 1 was screened for the presence of the 16-bp- or 18-bp-long cell barcode that matched the cell barcode in the whitelist provided by 10x genomics (extended data fig 10).first to exclude the possibility that higher calr expression in committed progenitors results in a greater ability to detect mutant alleles and thereby in a higher mutant-cell frequency we downsampled all cells to a single amplicon umi before mutation calling and found that the increase in mutation frequencies in mkp compared with hspc remained unchanged (fig 1f g).this frequency was then divided by the total mutant- cell frequency across all progenitor subsets for each of the iterations (fig 1f g 4c 5h extended data fig 5d).v. umicbread1 poly(dt) poly(dt)umicbread1 tso pcr#1 spikein pcr#2fw pcr#2rv pcr#3 rpi-x handle pcr#1 spikein tso si-pcr si-pcr

Reference sentences:[the breakpoint resolution (me- dian =150 kb for (b6 3 spret) and =250 kb for (b6 3 cast); figure 6b) is on par with previous efforts to map meiotic crossovers by single cell sequencing (150 - 500 kb) (lu et al. 2012; ottolini et al. 2015; wang et al. 2012); however the greater library complexity afforded by sci-l3-wgs enabled us to achieve this with a much lower sequencing depth.accounting for inter-chromosome variability with a linear mixed effect model we estimate that the positions of the rightmost crossovers in the (b6 3 spret) cross are on average 1.6 mb more centromere-proximal than those in the (b6 3 cast) cross in 1c cells (figure s7a p = 1e-13 f test) but are 5.5 mb more centromere-proximal in the m2 cells (figure 6c p = 2.2e-15).note that the rightmost cross- overs in the m2 cells tend to be more centromere-proximal than those in the 1c cells in both crosses but to a greater extent in the (b6 3 spret) cross (figure 6d) than in the (b6 3 cast) cross (figure s7b).with a subset of 25 variables of high inclusion probability (mip > 0.5) identified by bma we achieve a similar average auc of 0.72 (figure 6e).simi- larly for the (b6 3 cast) cross we achieve an average auc of 0.85 when all features or a subset of 25 features with mip > 0.5 are used (figure 6f).]

Reference sentences:[first we characterized the methods by the distribution of reads from each library with respect to their structure and alignment with the genome (extended data fig 3).in the mixture experiment both repli- cates of smart-seq2 and one replicate of indrops had the highest fraction of exonic reads (51.0% 53.7% and 56.9% respectively) with sci-rna-seq performing worst (28.7% and 29.4%; extended data fig 3a).overall the pbmc samples had a lower fraction of reads aligned to exons than the mixture samples (extended data fig 3ab) with one replicate of indrops having the highest fraction of exonic reads (46%) and seq-well having the lowest (20%; extended data fig 3b).while the relative performance of each method was gener- ally similar between the cortex nuclei and the other experiments there was a higher ratio of intron-aligning reads to exon-aligning reads in nuclei than in cells (extended data fig 3) as expected because nuclei contain a higher proportion of unspliced tran- scripts than whole cells28.similarly in pbmcs low-throughput methods detected more umis and genes per cell than the high-throughput methods (fig 3 and extended data fig 4b) with similar performance of smart-seq2 (2406 and 2632 median number of genes detected) and cel-seq2 (2717 and 2545; fig 3b).among the high-throughput methods 10x chromium (v3) had the highest median number of umis (4494) and genes (1482) per cell (fig 3) and indrops (366 and 1118 umis; 256 and 568 genes) and seq-well (844 and 577 umis; 513 and 372 genes) had the lowest (fig 3).as expected a 0 5000 15000 10000 20000 number of detected umis number of detected genes pbmc1 pbmc2 b 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 6156 1909 2392 4494 1120 366 5787 2627 1809 577 1118 2406 2717 785 876 1482 637 513 256 2632 2545 1110 898 372 568 844 cel-seq2 10x chromium (v2) a 10x chromium (v2) b 10x chromium (v3) drop-seq seq-well indrops cel-seq2 smart-seq2 10x chromium (v2) a 10x chromium (v2) b 10x chromium (v3) drop-seq seq-well indrops cel-seq2 smart-seq2 10x chromium (v3) drop-seq seq-well indrops cel-seq2 10x chromium (v2) drop-seq seq-well indrops fig 3 | pbmcs sensitivity.by contrast with the datas- ets with lower quality or numbers of cells the auc scores for cell clusters in the 10x chromium datasets did not consistently improve when all of the datasets were used with the harmony algorithm (supplementary fig 3).having a lower fraction of reads aligned to exons (extended data fig 3) could explain lower performance metrics in our comparisons for example in the seq-well pbmc datasets (fig 3 and 5).in our limited testing of 10x chromium (v3) it had higher sensitivity (fig 3) but we did not detect improved cell type identification (fig 5) and had a higher fraction of reads aligned to mitochondrial genes (supplementary fig 6).even with the inclusion of intron-aligning reads in our analysis a higher fraction of reads for 10x chromium and to a lesser extent for dronc-seq could not be analyzed because of the absence of a poly(t) sequence or aligning in an antisense orienta- tion (extended data fig 3).]

Reference sentences:[upon compar- ing pc1 and pc2 (or mofa factors 1 and 2) in addition to the expected lineage sep- aration obtained using the spliced reads (fig 2a left panel) we could also observe a degree of lineage separation when using the unspliced reads alone (fig 2a middle panel).genome biology (2021) 22:197 page 3 of 22 when spliced and unspliced information is used in combination (fig 2a right panel; see additional file 1: fig s1 for further components/factors).moreover the mofa fac- tors account for 16% of variation in the spliced data and 4% of the variation in unspliced data (fig 2bi).interestingly a closer look at the mofa pre-processing and final outcome showed a minor overlap of genes that are highly variable with respect to spliced or unspliced counts (fig 2bii) and a different weight contributed by the two layers to the final factors (fig 2biii).it is noteworthy however that our mofa analysis in fig 2 fully supports the notion that even with current datasets the unspliced reads alone provide a degree of lineage discrimination and contribute to a substantial proportion of the variance when used together with the spliced reads.the same objects used as mofa input were used for pca calculation in fig 2a.]
Summary: Distribution patterns of variance and lineage separation using spliced, unspliced, and combined reads in single-cell transcriptomes.
Step 1: Identify items. In this context, the 'items' are single-cell transcriptomes.
Step 2: Identify dimensions. The 'dimensions' mentioned are spliced reads, unspliced reads, and combined reads.
Step 3: Identify spatial location. In this context, it did not mention spatial distribution.
Step 4: Determine the label separately. Since the context discusses the distribution of dimensions (spliced reads, unspliced reads, and combined reads) across different items (single-cell transcriptomes),
the appropriate label is 'Distribution of dimension(s) on different items.'
Final output:
1. 'Distribution of dimension(s) on different items':
yes
2. 'Distribution of items in a 2D space':
no
3. 'Spatial distribution of item clusters or dimensions'
