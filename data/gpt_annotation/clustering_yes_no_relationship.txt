Reference sentences:[as expected from our sampling procedure and in accordance with the literature (jin et al. 2001) neurons were mostly radially oriented (fig 1b) (see table 8).a clustering tree (dendrogram) is then built starting from its leaves (individual cells) and grouping them into branched ramifications up to a common root (fig 1a).the hierarchic clustering tree generated by the ward’s method showed that cortical neurons are first segregated into two clusters (fig 1a).because npy was rarely expressed in glutamatergic cluster neurons (1 of 46; 2%) (fig 1a) (see table 3) this group was not considered for additional subdivision.these gabaergic neurons exhibited a much higher proportion of npy-expressing cells (40%; p = 0.001) (fig 1a).this cluster was further divided into two second-order branches (fig 1a).cluster 2.1 (n = 34 neurons) in which 29% of the neurons expressed npy (fig 1a) figure 1.cluster 2.2 neurons exhibited indeed different firing behaviors: continuous adapting (n = 95) bursting (n = 17) and delayed (n = 8) and different morphologies (fig 1b).its two branches revealed heterogeneous molecular electrophysiological and morphological features as well (fig 1ab).in addition cluster 2.2.1 contained the majority of adapting neurons (61%) whereas cluster 2.2.2 contained the large majority of bursting neurons (88%) and all delayed neurons suggesting that both clusters are composed of different populations and can be further subdivided (fig 1a).almost all cluster 2.2.1.1 neurons expressed som (94%) in addition to npy (70%) (fig 1a) (see table 3).cluster 2.2.1.2 neurons rarely expressed npy (16%) (fig 1a) (see table 3) but frequently vip (74%; see table 3).similarly cluster 2.2.2.1 neurons rarely expressed npy (18%) (fig 1a) compared with vip (77%; see table 3).npy was frequently expressed (76%) (fig 1a) in cluster 2.2.2.2 neurons which mainly contained adapting neurons (n = 30) and all delayed neurons (n = 8).the majority of fs-pv cells (n = 11 of 15) displayed a multipolar dendritic morphology (fig 1ba4 a5) (see table 8) with the remaining fs-pv neurons being either tufted (n = 2) or bipolar (n = 2).the axon of the multipolar fs-pv cells was basically restricted to their home layer with an overall configuration being compatible with basket cells (fig 1ba4 a5) (kawaguchi 1995; wang et al. 2002) but not with chandelier cells (kawaguchi 1995).som was detected in all (but one) neurons (n = 17) of this cluster and was frequently coexpressed with cb and npy (fig 1a 3b; table 3) two molecular markers classically associated with som (kubota et al. 1994; gonchar and burkhalter 1997; gonchar et al. 2007).a very low proportion of som neurons (n = 1 of 17) expressed nos-1 (fig 1a).morphologically recovered adapting som neurons (n = 11) displayed a radially oriented dendritic arbor (fig 1ba6; table 8) and were bipolar (n = 3) tufted (n = 4) or multipolar (n = 4).basic inspection of their axonal arbor revealed an axon ascending (n = 8 of 11) into and arborizing in layer i (n = 5 of 11) (fig 1ba6) a morphological feature of som-expressing martinotti cells of rats (kawaguchi and kubota 1996;

table 3) and nos-1 was more frequently detected in these neurons than in any other cell class (fig 1a 4b; table 3).similarly to fs-pv neurons morphologically examined adapting npy neurons (n = 21) displayed a large number of primary dendrites emanating in all direction (fig 1ba9 a10).neurosci. march 18 2009 • 29(11):3642–3659 • 3649 axon ramifying in all directions (fig 1ba9 a10) resembling those of neurogliaform neurons (kawaguchi 1995;

connors and gutnick 1990; nelson et al. 2006; sugino et al. 2006).glutamatergic neurons exhibited spiny stellate (n = 10) (fig 1ba2) star pyramidal (n = 2) (fig 1ba3) or pyramidal cell (n = 16) (fig 1ba1) figure 3.top inset ir videomicroscopy picture of the same neuron that presented a large and radially oriented soma pial surface is upward (scale bar 10 =m) (see also fig 1b a6).in good agreement with previous reports (cauli et al. 1997;

cauli et al. 1997; porter et al. 1998) their axonal arbor was mainly descending (fig 1ba7 a8) and in some cases reached the border of the white matter (fig 1ba7).interestingly all neurons of the left branch of the ward adapting npy cluster (n = 8) (fig 1a) expressed nos-1.]

Reference sentences:[indeed secretagogin was found chiefly co-expressed with crh in pvn in both neuronal soma and local axon collaterals (fig 4d–e3) and less frequently with tyrosine hydroxylase (ventrolateral arcuate nucleus; fig 4f–f3) gaba (dorsomedial arcuate nucleus; fig 4g–g2) somatostatin (fig 4h–h3) and galanin (fig 4i–i2) with dual-labeled secretory terminals accumulating in the median eminence (fig 5a–a2).a1 a2 e a b1 c1 b d c e1 e2 e3 figure 5.this notion is supported by secretagogin’s concentration and co-localization with crh in the median eminence (fig 5a–a2) the locus of the first capillary network of the hypothalamic artery that collects releasing hormones produced by neurosecretory cells including crh (harris 1972; le´ra´nth et al 1983; swanson & sawchenko 1983).in particular we employed pre-embedding silver-intensified immunogold labeling to show at the ultrastructural level that secretagogin is present in axon terminals with frequent association with the plasmalemma and possibly also with the outer membrane of dense-core vesicles (fig 5b and b1; for quantitative data in axons see fig 2d).next we addressed whether secretagogin is a ca2+ sensor to influence neurotransmitter transport and vesicular release by defining its ca2+-dependent interactome using unbiased matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight (maldi-tof) proteomics (fig 5c).our hits (97 proteins in ca2+-dependent interactions and 15 proteins without ca2+ dependence (supplementary table s3); minimum number of peptide fragments ≥ 2 protein threshold: 99% peptide threshold: 99%) therefore were interpreted as recruited upon ca2+ influx (fig 5c1 supplementary table s3) and chiefly included proteins implicated in: (i) vesicle formation fusion and traffic; (ii) enzymatic reactions; (iii) signaling; and (iv) cytoskeletal dynamics and axonal transport (fig 5c1) (sudhof 2004; schluter et al 2006; wickner & schekman 2008).we also uncovered interactions with other ca2+-binding proteins glutamate decarboxylase and vesicular gaba transporter (fig 5c1) reinforcing our transcriptome analysis.we validated the expression of mrnas for many of these proteins in secretagogin+ neurons by targeted analysis of our single-cell transcriptome data (fig 5d).this approach revealed the expression of multiple genes of interest involved in vesicular traffic and fusion in secretagogin+ parvocellular neurons (fig 5d).lastly we performed immunohistochemistry in rat paraventricular neurons and median eminence with antibodies raised against rab3 (all isoforms) to visualize secretagogin’s frequent co-existence with this family of proteins at the median eminence (fig 5e–e3).considering that secretagogin= nerve endings also exist in the median eminence our results also suggest that as yet unknown and additional ca2+-dependent or ca2+-independent sensor proteins might exist to control the release of hormones distinct from crh galanin or somatostatin (fig 5).]

Reference sentences:[pca of cdcs distinguished the two naïve cell types along pc2 (fig 6a and fig s21) with an efficiency consistent with recent data (35) and further highlighted a number of expected and previously unknown cdc subset-specific genes (fig s22).we next compared naïve cdcs with those from infection (fig 6a and fig s21) and separated these along pc6 (fig 6a).analysis of differential gene expression in cdcs due to infection identified 30 genes 29 of which were up-regulated (fig 6b and fig s23) including transcription factors stat1 and irf1 and fig 4.for example stat1 and irf1 were expressed by several naïve cdcs and further up-regulated during infection (fig 6c).this was similar for cxcl9 which was expressed by cd8+ cdcs in naive mice whereas cxcl10 was induced only upon infection (fig 6c).next pca of ly6chi monocytes from naïve and infected mice distinguished them from each other along pc2 (fig 6d and fig s24).differential gene expression analysis between naïve and infected groups uncovered ~100 genes both up-regulated and down-regulated during infection (fig 6e and fig s25).a high proportion (~40%) of genes upregulated in cdcs were also induced in ly6chi monocytes including stat1 irf1 and cxcl10 (fig 6 e and f) suggesting possible overlapping functionality.in addition monocytes expressed other chemokines including cxcl2 ccl2 and ccl3 (fig 6 e and f).to test this we first assessed chemokine expression at the protein level by ly6chi monocytes (fig 6g).next we used lysmcre × idtr mice in which ly6chi monocytes were depleted after pbtii cell activation but before bifurcation (fig 6h and fig s27).using this approach we found that monocytes/ macrophages supported a th1 but not a tfh fate (fig 6h).2 eaal2192 (2017) 3 march 2017 scie n c e i m m u no lo gy | r esea r ch articl e 8 of 11 fig 6.]

Reference sentences:[such index-sorted hspcs derived from the bone marrow of two healthy individuals were subjected to rna-seq analysis (‘indexomics’ 1034 and 379 single cells; see supplementary fig 1b for the distribution of cells within classically defined gates56 and supplementary fig 2 for quality metrics of single-cell rna-seq) to determine their transcriptomes or individually cultured ex vivo (‘index-culture’ 2038 single cells) to quantify megakaryocytic erythroid and myeloid lineage potential.in both individuals the lin−cd34+cd38+ progenitors could be separated into clusters corresponding to distinct progenitor cell types of all major branches of haematopoiesis (fig 2a and see below).a simulated series of random steps from an individual cell to one of its nearest neighbours (see methods) revealed that the majority of lin−cd34+cd38− cells were highly interconnected contrasting the disconnected cell types from the lin−cd34+cd38+ compartment (fig 2b).locally clustered cell populations with the exception of some phenotypic common myeloid progenitors (cmps) and cd10+ mlps suggesting that the classification based on diﬀerential cd38 expression is excellent but not absolute (fig 2c).classes obtained from hierarchical clustering of the lin−cd34+cd38+ compartment (fig 2a) were assigned to putative cell types based on analyses of gene and surface marker expression.(b) averaged gene expression profiles for cell types from both individuals defined in fig 2a were clustered on the basis of the 1000 most variable genes.while the frequently used smart-seq2 protocol44 failed to amplify transcriptomes from bone marrow-derived human hspcs both the quartz-seq protocol45 and a modified smart-seq2 protocol (see below) yielded good-quality cdna (supplementary fig 2a).statistics on these filtering steps are displayed in supplementary fig 2.we designed a normalization method to address the following two challenges: single-cell transcriptomics has large technical variability; and human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells largely diﬀer in rna content (supplementary fig 2h).while lowly expressed genes are sometimes observed in cells with high total rna content they are almost never seen in cells with low total rna content (supplementary fig 2i).in our data set the first principal component was correlated to the library size and mrna content which may dominate over the eﬀects of developmental transitions (supplementary fig 2j panel i).normalization through division by total library size or harmonic mean estimator does not resolve this issue as lowly expressed genes are still unobserved (zero) in cells of low mrna content (supplementary fig 2ij panel ii).the use of por scores in principal component analysis solved the problems associated with the abovementioned normalization strategies (supplementary fig 2j panel iii).we therefore trained an elastic-net regularized generalized linear model (glmnet) of the multinomial family on the most mature populations (n1-3 ebm md spb1/2 e1/2 and mk from fig 2a for individual 1 or lpb ebm n me and md for individual 2) using class membership as the response variable.

the low sensitivity of the scrna-seq by calculating the technical dropout probability3240 (fig 4e).c left bar plot representing the proportion of tregs belonging to the resting clusters 5 and 6

tregs.these predictions were confirmed with expression of cxcr3 on cd62llo tregs and the highest levels of cxcr3 on nr4a1– tregs (fig 4e).we then interrogated these data to determine the frequency and distribution of expression of treg effector molecules5 (fig 4f).we estimated their frequencies of expression after dropout correction as in fig 4e which were consistent with the frequencies observed by intracellular flow cytometry analysis of splenic tregs (data not shown).effector molecule expression was not mutually exclusive and we identified coexpressed effector molecules (fig 4f).tregs from different nr4a1 expression bins formed a trajectory from low to high expression (fig 5b) reproducing the main axis of treg heterogeneity observed in fig 4.the data (1265 to 1567 cells per bin) were processed and analyzed in the probabilistic framework described for fig 4 and each cell was assigned according to its probability of belonging to clusters 1–6 (supplementary fig 6).however mirroring the biased representation of nr4a1 transcripts among activated treg clusters (fig 4) the distribution of activated tregs varied markedly with nr4a1-gfp intensity.in addition and also consistent with the negatively correlated expression of nr4a1 and cxcr3 (fig 4) we found an under-representation of cxcr3+ tregs in the nr4a1med and nr4a1hi pools (fig 5e).highlighted genes are those specifically

levels of β-cell-associated transcription factors (such as nkx6.1 nkx2.2 and neurod1) (figure 8e and figure s6a) as well as genes involved in glucose transport and insulin secretion (such as slc2a2 tmem27 and slc30a8) (figure 8f and figure s6a).in contrast pancreatic ductal markers (such as sox9 and krt19) as well as the “pancreatic islet disallowed” genes44 were completely suppressed in the

early marker genes for sst neurons: sst tspan7 satb1; fig 4e extended data fig 7).by e18.5 all cardinal types of interneurons could be identified and additional subtypes appeared to be transcriptionally specified as well (fig 4e extended data fig 9).for example the gene encoding the transcription factor mef2c was among those that discriminated early pvalb-precursors from other mge-derived interneuron types (fig 4e).consistent with our predictions conditional deletion of mef2c in inhibitory neurons led to a specific loss of pvalb-interneurons by p20 in cortical layers 2–6 (fig 4f g extended data fig 10) indicating that mef2c is essential for the generation of this population.notably when examining a published single-nucleus rna-seq dataset of human post mortem tissue29 we found that a subset of embryonic cardinal type markers from our mouse dataset (including mef2c) was also differentially expressed in adult human interneurons (fig 4h).as the recombination mediated by these two driver lines is indistinguishable they are used interchangeably in fig 4f g respectively.percentages presented in fig 4 were calculated by dividing the number of markerpositive neurons in each layer (for example layer i layer ii/iii layer iv and layer v/vi) by the total number of reporter-positive neurons.to remove mitotic progenitors from the lhx6-negative cge dataset we performed a maturation trajectory analysis as outlined above and kept only postmitotic cells (2905 cells extended data fig 4h–j).this step removed 465 cells leaving 2440 lhx6-negative postmitotic cells (extended data fig 4k).in a final step we turned all p values into fdrs and mapped only cells with an fdr < 0.1 to the branches (extended data fig 4l–n).specifically we used the lhx6-gfp transgenic mouse line to select for postmitotic mge cells and to precisely discriminate mge versus cge precursor cells at e14.5 (extended data fig 4).for visualization (fig 4b) we constructed a distance matrix from these selected components as input to tsne with default parameters.we performed this mapping procedure twice to assign cells to the four main cardinal types (fig 4b–d) and also to assign them to the 14 finer subtypes (extended data fig 9) to identify differentially expressed genes that were conserved across development we used the findconservedmarkers command in seurat which runs differential expression tests separately on both developmental and adult datasets.figure 4e and extended data fig 7 lists these genes in order of when they first become annotated as differentially expressed.article research extended data figure 4 | see next page for caption.article research extended data figure 4 | fate divergence occurs as cells become postmitotic.this figure is identical to fig 4e but with all gene names displayed.cells are coloured as in fig 4b–d based on their mapping to p56 datasets in integrated analysis.in each case we can see that the cardinal type separation that we observe via integrated analysis (fig 4b–d) is consistent with an independent analysis of each dataset.a t-sne visualization of all p10 cells mapping to a p56 subtype (as in right column of fig 4c but cells are coloured by subtype instead of cardinal type).d t-sne visualization of all e18.5 cells mapping to a p56 subtype (as in right column of fig 4c but cells are coloured by subtype instead of cardinal type).markers of transcriptomic cardinal types from our e13.5 and e18.5 datasets (from fig 4e) are shown in red or blue dots.]

Reference sentences:[we confirmed that there was no batch effect by projecting the cells from different tubes onto the same tsne (supplemental figure 3).we sequenced 4259 nuclei to a similar depth as the biopsy and identified six distinct epithelial cell clusters including podocytes proximal tubule loop of henle distal tubule principal cells and intercalated cells (figure 3 a–c).unsupervised analysis of combined cells from all six clusters (three healthy and three rejection) by tsne resulted in the expected three cell types indicating that rejection did not fundamentally alter tubular cell identity (figure 3d supplemental figure 6).consistent with this interpretation projecting the source of cells onto this tsne confirmed that healthy proximal tubule was overlaid with rejecting proximal tubule as was loop of henle and collecting duct (figure 3e).despite the overall similarity between healthy and rejecting proximal tubule loop of henle and collecting duct differential gene analysis revealed downregulation of terminal differentiation markers and upregulation of proinﬂammatory genes in biopsy epithelia (figure 3f).the proximal tubule in particular expressed proinﬂammatory cytokine genes such as cxcl14 which induces monocyte chemotaxis and il32 which induces expression of tnfa by macrophages (figure 3f).collectively figure 3.we found a smooth transition between healthy and activated proximal tubule cells (figure 3g and f).]

(c) subtype proportions are significantly altered in vglut3à/à animals compared to wt, with a dramatic loss of ic sgns. p values indicate results of test of equal proportions between ia, ib, and ic subtypes in the two genetic backgrounds.']. Reference sentences:[in a t-sne plot wild-type (wt) middle-turn sgns again segregated into three distinct groups (figure 7a).to corroborate these results we utilized random forest an ensemble machine-learning approach for supervised classification of vglut3=/= cells based on subtype definitions derived from wt cells (figure 7b).after verifying that the classifier performed robustly (figures s7e–s7g; see the star methods) predictions for sgns from vglut3=/= animals were generated (colored triangles in figure 7b).we found that 73% of the mutant cells were transcriptionally similar to ia sgns 25% were ib-like and 3% were ic-like (figure 7c).indeed pooled comparison of scrna-seq profiles of mutant and wt sgns revealed a broad transcriptional shift toward the ia phenotype with downregulation of multiple ib and ic markers such as ttn and lypd1 respectively (figure 7d).this contrasts with the steep gradient from zero to high expression observed among wt cells (standard deviation = 0.78) (figure 7e).changes in proportions of neurons expressing other ib/ic-specific or ia-enriched transcription factors and axon guidance molecules (figure 7e) are consistent with the interpretation that sgn subtypes are significantly altered in vglut3=/= animals.however by p8 the proportion of cells expressing the ic marker lypd1 is decreased significantly in vglut3=/= animals (all lypd1+ sgns: 0.55 and 0.22 p = 7.7 3 10=3; only lypd1+ sgns: 0.13 and 0.01 p = 0.049 in control and vglut3=/= respectively) (figure 7g 7g’ 7i and 7i’).this is accompanied by an increased proportion of calb2+ sgns (only calb2+ sgns: 0.40 and 0.68 p = 7.5 3 10=3 in control and vglut3=/= respectively) (figure 7i’’).these changes persist into the fourth postnatal week (figures 7h and 7h’) with significantly lower lypd1+ sgn proportion at p27 in vglut3=/= animals (all lypd1+ sgns: 0.30 and 0.03 p = 4.2 3 10=4; only lypd1+ sgns: 0.22 and 0.007 p = 4 3 10=3 in control and vglut3=/= respectively) (figure 7i and 7i’) consistent with scrna-seq results (figures 7a–7e).in control animals the proportion of lypd1+ sgns decreases modestly (=13%) between p3 and p8 (figure 7i blue line) consistent with the expected gradual refinement of sgn (d and e) sgns from wt and vglut3=/= animals show broad differences in gene expression reﬂective of a shift from ic to ia identity shown both in a heatmap (d) and in scatterplots (e) of the level of expression of ia (calb2 rxrg pcdh20) and ib/ic (lypd1 pou4f1 ntng1 runx1) subtype markers (wt top; vglut3=/= bottom).however in vglut3=/= animals the proportion of lypd1+ sgns drops drastically (=70%) (figure 7i red line).at the same time the proportion of sgns that express only lypd1+ (and not calb2) does not increase over time in contrast to controls (figure 7i’).instead the proportion of calb2+-only sgns increases between p3 and p8 to a much greater extent in vglut3=/= animals (+161%) than in controls (+21%) (figure 7i’’).thus in vglut3=/= animals the calb2 gradient does not sharpen and there is a dramatic loss in lypd1 expression as if most remaining sgns retained a ia identity rather than taking on a ib/c identity in the first postnatal week and beyond (figure 7j).thus our data indicate that ihc-driven activity is required for the developmental refinement of sgn identities from an early phase of broad and overlapping marker expression to subtype-restricted expression with impairment of this process causing a drastic shift in sgn subtype proportions within the first postnatal week which persists in the mature cochlea (figure 7j).cluster identities in the key to the right are based on figure 7a.]

which are also known as copy number variants) (range 7–99%) were discordant (extended data fig 1c–e).indeed a median of 22% of the genome was estimated to be affected by subclonal events across 916 ccle cell lines (extended data fig 1f) suggesting that changes in subclonal composition may underlie the observed differences.genetic variation across 27 mcf7 strains we performed extensive genomic characterization of 27 versions (hereafter called ‘strains’) of the commonly used oestrogen receptor (er)-positive breast cancer cell line mcf712–14 (methods extended data fig 1g–n 2a b and supplementary table 2) including 19 strains that had not undergone drug treatment or genetic manipulation 7 strains that carried a genetic modification generally considered to be neutral (for example introduction of a reporter gene cas9 or a dna barcode) and one strain (mcf7-m) that had been expanded in vivo in mice following anti-oestrogen therapy.of these changes 7% of gains and 13% of losses were detected in only a single strain and the remaining events were observed variably across strains (fig 1b and 1broad institute of harvard and mit cambridge ma usa.for example pten was deleted in 17 strains and retained in the other 10 (fig 1c).similarly the oestrogen receptor gene esr1 was gained in 12 strains lost in 6 and unaltered in 9 (fig 1c) and this correlated with differential expression of erα (p = 0.009; extended data fig 3b c and supplementary discussion).only 35% of 95 non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (snvs) and indels that affected the coding sequence or splice regions were shared by all strains: 29% were unique to a single strain and the remaining were present in a subset of strains (fig 1d e extended data fig 3dj supplementary tables 5 6 and supplementary discussion).for example strain m which had been subjected to in vivo passaging and drug treatment was the most genetically distinct; the 11 strains used by the connectivity map project16 over a 10-year period clustered tightly together; and sibling strains d and e which were only a few passages apart were the closest to each other (fig 1f g and extended data fig 3g).the genetic distance between strains appeared to be affected more by passage number and genetic manipulation than by freeze–thaw cycles (fig 1h and extended data fig 4).notably the 27 strains clustered similarly in the space of mutations and expression profiles and the expected downstream consequences of genetic mutations were observed in the gene expression variation (fig 1f g 3b–g extended data fig 6e–i and supplementary table 14).colours as in fig 1.however at least one strain was entirely resistant (<20% growth inhibition) to 48 out of these 55 (87%) active compounds (fig 4a b and extended data fig 10a).the same phenomenon was observed at a more stringent threshold: of 42 compounds with strong activity in at least two strains 33 (79%) were inactive in at least two strains (extended data fig 10b–d j and supplementary discussion).all 33 differentially active compounds were validated in an eight-point dose–response analysis of each of the 27 strains (median spearman’s ρ = 0.42 between screens p = 3 × 10−9; extended data fig 10k supplementary table 27 and supplementary discussion).first replicate treatments yielded highly concordant results (median pearson’s r = 0.97 p < 2 × 10−16; extended data fig 10l).for example the same activity pattern was observed for three proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib mg-132 and carfilzomib; fig 4d) and was associated with biochemically measured differential proteasome activity (extended data fig 10m–o).third for 82% of differentially active compounds we found differential gene expression signatures of the mechanism of action27 of the compounds between sensitive and insensitive strains (p = 2 × 10−5; fig 4e–h extended data fig 10p–u and supplementary tables 28 29).for example strains sensitive to cdk inhibitors had an upregulated cell cycle signature and strains sensitive to pi3k inhibitors had an upregulated mtor signature (fig 4f g and extended data fig 10p q).notably the strains that were the most resistant to treatment in general (strains m and q) showed downregulation of drug metabolism pathways (extended data fig 10v).for example genetic inactivation of pten was associated with decreased pten and increased akt expression signatures (fig 1c e 3e f) and increased sensitivity to the akt inhibitor iv (fig 4h i).similarly esr1 loss was associated with reduced oestrogen signalling (fig 1c 3g) which was in turn associated with reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen or oestrogen depletion (fig 4j and extended data fig 10w–x).more broadly clustering of the mcf7 strains based on their drug response was highly similar to clustering based on genetics or gene expression (fig 1g 2a 3b 4a extended data fig 11a and supplementary discussion).genome-wide crispr screens showed that genetic dependencies were affected by genomic variation similar to pharmacological dependencies (extended data fig 11b–f supplementary table 31 and supplementary discussion) and functional analyses revealed that single-cell-derived clones remained g early oestrogen response esr1 loss (n = 6) vs others (n = 21) –0.45 0 p < 0.001 q < 0.001 0 0.5 mtor signaling f ptenmut (n = 13) vs others (n = 14) p < 0.001 q < 0.001 rank 0 0.35 e mtor signaling pten del (n = 17) vs others (n = 10) p < 0.001 q < 0.006 enrichment score –0.4 –0.2 0 enrichment score chr.colours as in fig 1. c schematics of the analysis performed to evaluate the association between genetic variation and transcriptional programs.article research phenotypically unstable (extended data fig 11g–i and supplementary discussion).colours as in fig 1.cell line diversification can therefore be estimated using inexpensive profiling methods (extended data fig 11j).to implement the force-directed layout described in extended data fig 11b the full corrected dependency matrix was reduced to its top 100 principle components and a k-means clustering algorithm was run repeatedly on cell lines.article research extended data fig 1 | comparison of broad and sanger genomic features across 106 cell lines.for gel source data see supplementary fig 1.groups of strains expected to cluster together based on their evolutionary history are highlighted as in fig 1.groups of strains expected to cluster together based on their evolutionary history are highlighted as in fig 1.groups of strains expected to cluster together based on their evolutionary history are highlighted as in fig 1.article research extended data fig 10 | see next page for caption.article research extended data fig 10 | characterization of drug-response variation across 27 mcf7 strains.groups of strains expected to cluster together based on their evolutionary history are highlighted as in fig 1. b pie chart of the classification of the screened compounds based on their differential activity.for gel source data see supplementary fig 1. o quantification of the relative expression of psmc2 and psmd1.article research extended data fig 11 | see next page for caption.article research extended data fig 11 | comparison of genetictranscriptomicand drug-response-based clustering trees genomic distances and crispr dependencies.]

Reference sentences:[notably most cycling cells (98.5% of all cycling cells) were identified as epithelial consistent with our cell type classification and suggesting that the malignant cells reside in this compartment (fig 1e; supplementary fig 2).indeed we observed a high correlation between the predicted proportion of cycling cells and the percentage of ki67positive cells within each tumor (fig 1e; supplementary fig 2).analysis of all cells across patients usingof tsne clustering20 revealed substantial separation between nonepithelial populations which were well-segregated into distinct clusters based on their cell type and epithelial populations which formed multiple subgroups (fig 2a).this pattern was most apparent when non-epithelial and epithelial cells were analyzed separately (fig 2b c).in contrast to non-epithelial cells epithelial cells generally separated into tumor-specific clusters (particularly tumors 39 and 81) but interestingly also into clusters with contribution of cells from multiple tumors (fig 2a–c).as predicted we found that subclonal large-scale cnvs were evident in some (particularly tumors 39 and 81) but not all tumors and no tumors showed a clonal pattern of cnvs shared by all cells (fig 2d).we then validated these findings by bulk whole-exome sequencing (wes fig 2e; supplementary fig 3) which demonstrated high concordance between cnvs inferred by single-cell transcriptomic data and cnvs demonstrated in the genomic data (fig 2d e).for instance tumor 39 (9.5 cm tumor) exhibited a dominant subclonal population whereas tumor 89 (1.5 cm tumor) showed little evidence for such a population (fig 2d e).d f c b a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 expression score −2 −1 0 1 2 cnv mean e pt039 pt081 pt084 pt089 primary tumor pt039 pt058 pt081 pt084 pt089 pt126 cell type epithelial −15 −10 −5 0 5 10 −10 −5 0 5 10 component 2 component 1 primary tumor pt039 pt058 pt081 pt084 pt089 pt126 cell type stroma endothelial t cell b cell macrophage −20 0 20 0 20 component 2 primary tumor pt039 pt058 pt081 pt084 pt089 pt126 cell type epithelial stroma endothelial t cell b cell macrophage component 1 –20 −20 −10 0 10 20 30 −30 −20 −10 0 10 20 component 1 component 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 normal pt039 pt058 pt081 pt084 pt089 pt126 spearman correlation 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 epithelial cells normal pt039 pt058 pt081 pt084 pt089 pt126 clonal nonclonal clonal nonclonal clonal nonclonal clonal nonclonal fig 2 clustering genomic cnvs and correlation maps classify most epithelial cells as malignant.as anticipated the normal epithelial cells showed a reasonably high degree of concordance (mean spearman correlation 0.38) as did the subgroups of cells from patients 39 and 81 defined by subclonal cnvs (spearman correlations 0.45 for tumor 39 and 0.41 for tumor 81) which were also identified as distinct clusters of epithelial cells (fig 2c; supplementary fig 4).in contrast the remaining tumor epithelial cells generally showed weaker concordance both within and between tumors supporting their heterogeneity and therefore their likely identity as malignant cells (spearman correlations: 0.25 for patient 89 0.26 for 84 0.30 for 58 and 126) (fig 2f).as our clustering analysis demonstrated subgroups of epithelial cells sharing common transcriptional profiles but derived from multiple tumors (fig 2c) we next sought to reveal the common biology of these groups via clustering of all epithelial cells while excluding patient-specific effects through linear regression.taken together with the analyses in fig 2 these findings support the malignant identity of clusters 2 3 and 4 while the small number of cells in clusters 1 and 5 can less confidently be identified as malignant cells due to their less proliferative phenotype.this finding agrees with the relative homogeneity of this tumor documented by cnv and intercellular heterogeneity analyses (fig 2d–f; supplementary fig 11 12).we found that a gene signature representative of glycosphingolipid metabolism46 (supplementary table 4) was predictive of overall survival for tnbc patients in the metabric cohort with progressively higher expression significantly associated with increasingly worse overall survival in this tnbc cohort (supplementary fig 21).all cells that were at least 4 median absolute deviations (mads) below the median for any of these three metrics were removed from downstream analyses55 (supplementary fig 22).to normalize single-cell rna-seq data a three step strategy was employed: (1) transform the tpm values into relative counts with the census algorithm (function relative2abs from the r package monocle56); (2) normalize the census counts with the deconvolution strategy implemented in the r package scran57; (3) remove additional sources of unwanted variation in the scrannormalized census counts with ruvseq58(ruvg) (supplementary fig 23).this normalization strategy strongly reduced the impact of many known sources of technical variability and confounding factors from the expression data (supplementary fig 24–30 and supplementary table 6).]

alm of adult mice (96.3% at postnatal day (p) 53–59 supplementary table 1) of both sexes in the congenic c57bl/6j background (extended data fig 1a).we obtained 10752 cells from layer-enriching dissections of alm and visp of pan-neuronal pan-glutamatergic or pan-gabaergic recombinase driver lines crossed to recombinase reporters (referred to as the pan collection; extended data fig 1 supplementary table 2).to sample non-neuronal cells compensate for cell survival biases and collect rare types we supplemented the pan collection with 10414 cells isolated from a variety of recombinase driver lines and reporter-negative cells with or without layer-enriching dissections (extended data fig 1b h i).to investigate the correspondence between transcriptomic types and neuronal projection properties we analysed 2656 retrogradely labelled cells (retro-seq dataset fig 1a) resulting in 2204 cells in the annotated retro-seq dataset (extended data fig 2c).article research by assigning identity to each cluster based on previously reported and newly discovered differentially expressed genes (extended data fig 5) we identified 56 glutamatergic 61 gabaergic and 16 non-neuronal types (fig 1).a clear hierarchy of transcriptomic cell types and their relationships emerged (fig 1).we refer to major branches as classes (for example glutamatergic class) and related groups of types as subclasses (for example l6b subclass) (fig 1c).most neurons fall into two major branches corresponding to glutamatergic and gabaergic classes (fig 1).almost all gabaergic types contain cells from both alm and visp (fig 1c 2a) with the exception of sst–tac1–tacr3 and pvalb–reln–itm2a types which are visp-specific.by contrast the glutamatergic types are mostly segregated by area (fig 1c 2a) with the exception of five shared types: one l6 ct type three l6b types and the cr–lhx5 type.we performed differential gene expression tests between the bestmatched almand visp-specific types (mostly glutamatergic; extended data fig 10c) and between almand visp-portions of shared types (mostly gabaergic and non-neuronal) (fig 2b).we confirm the area-specific expression of several genes by rna in situ hybridization (ish) from the allen brain atlas25 (extended data fig 10d e).projection targets (fig 3b extended data fig 10) were selected based on the allen mouse brain connectivity atlas28 and other anatomical data29.we assigned identities to glutamatergic neuron types based on their projection patterns (fig 3c d) dominant layer-of-dissection (fig 1c 4b) and expression of marker genes (fig 4c extended data fig 5).c number of differentially expressed genes between best-matched almand visp-specific cell types (extended data fig 10c) or alm and visp portions for shared types.cell types on the x axis are coloured as in fig 1; black horizontal line separates matched alm and visp types but not the shared types.tissue was microdissected from the collection site (alm or visp) and processed as shown in fig 1b.only glutamatergic cells from the annotated retro-seq dataset were included: n = 1138 out of 1152 annotated cells in c and 1049 out of 1052 annotated cells in d. see extended data fig 10a b for further details.we validated the preferential residence layer for neuronal cell bodies of select types by rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) and neuronal projections by anterograde labelling (extended data fig 11).the it types constitute the largest branch in both the visp and alm glutamatergic taxonomies (fig 1c 3c d) and span most layers.anterograde labelling confirms these findings and refines our knowledge of cortico–cortical projections (extended data fig 11).for example it types preferentially target different laminae in same target areas—upper layers for l2–l3 and l5 it types and lower ones for l6 it types (extended data fig 11f–h).pyramidal tract neurons the descending output neurons in l5 share a separate branch in the taxonomy (fig 1c).the three pyramidal tract transcriptomic types in the alm correspond to two projection classes21: two project to the thalamus whereas the third projects to the medulla (extended data fig 10a).similarly it seems that pyramidal tract types from the visp display differential subcortical projections (extended data fig 10b).corticothalamic (ct) l6 types (fig 3c d) share the transcription factor marker foxp2 (fig 4b c) and may have cell-type-specific preferences for different thalamic nuclei (extended data fig 10b).three other l6b types in the visp project to the anterior cingulate area (extended data fig 10b).in addition it shows that l6b neurons in the visp and alm project to l1 within resident and neighbouring cortical areas (extended data fig 11j).b dendrograms correspond to glutamatergic portion of fig 1c.anterograde tracing of neurons labelled by a new cre line slc17a8-ires2-cre reveals only sparse projections to neighbouring areas (extended data fig 11k) earning this subclass the name ‘near projecting’.gabaergic cell type taxonomy by scrna-seq we define six subclasses of gabaergic cells: sst pvalb vip lamp5 sncg and serpinf1 and two distinct types: sst–chodl and meis2– adamts19 (fig 1c).c d dendrograms are portions of fig 1c focused on the main gabaergic branch.sst–calb2–pdlim5 corresponds to sst+ and calb2+ l2/3 martinotti cells163536 (fig 5e extended data fig 12a) whereas some of the deep-layer sst types (for example sst– chrna2–glra3) express chrna2 a gene detected in l5 martinotti cells37.for the pvalb subclass we confirm that the pvalb–vipr2 type (pvalb– cpne5 in our previous study20) corresponds to chandelier cells by mapping of the recently reported chandelier cell (chc1) rna-seq data36 to our pvalb–vipr2 type (extended data fig 12a).several other pvalb types (pvalb– gpr149–islr pvalb–tpbg and pvalb–reln–tac1) correspond to basket cells36 (extended data fig 12a b).the sncg subclass corresponds to the vip+ and cck+ multipolar or basket cells and is distinct from cells of the vip subclass that are also calb2+ and have bipolar morphologies163536 (fig 5f extended data fig 12a).we confirm this finding by mapping of published patch-seq data38 to our data (extended data fig 12d–f) and find correspondence of neurogliaform cells to lamp5–plch2–dock5 and lamp5–lsp1 types.in addition we find that single bouquet cells map mostly to lamp5–fam19a1–tmem182 and find a possible transitional single bouquet–neurogliaform cell type lamp5–ntn1–npy2r (extended data fig 12d).this type is labelled by tamoxifen induction at embryonic day (e) 18 of nkx2.1creert2 mice (extended data fig 8) and was isolated previously36 from the same cre line (extended data fig 12a–c).we find that the rna-seq data of chandelier type 2 cells (chc2)36 map primarily to our lamp5–lhx6 type (extended data fig 12a b) which is transcriptomically most related to lamp5 neurogliaform types.to illustrate this we focus on the l4–it–visp–rspo1 type which consists of 1404 cells and displays heterogeneity along the first principal component (extended data fig 14a–c).the extent of the heterogeneity between the ends of this type is similar to heterogeneity between this type and a neighbouring type (l4–it–visp–rspo1 and l5–it–visp–hsd11b1–endou extended data fig 14d e).this cluster maps to three clusters connected by many intermediate cells in our previous study20 (extended data fig 14b).as expected less stringent statistical criteria yield more types and vice versa (extended data fig 14f).to determine whether we can detect activity-dependent changes that may be indicative of states in our cell types we mapped our cells to visp transcriptomic clusters from dark-reared animals some of which were exposed to light before euthanasia40 (extended data fig 15).therefore our clustering criteria are appropriate to capture at least some cell states whereas more stringent criteria may overlook them (extended data fig 14f; the sst–tac1–tacr3 cluster merges with sst–tac1–htr1d).although we detect area-specific differences in gene expression within gabaergic types (fig 2 extended data fig 16) they are usually insufficient to define subtypes with our statistical criteria.most glutamatergic types in visp or alm project to different cortical and subcortical targets (fig 3 extended data fig 10) whereas nearly all gabaergic interneurons form local connections.alternative analyses of these landscapes lead to more cluster splits (more discreteness) or merges (more continuous variation) (extended data fig 14f).the detected and described (versus actual) discreteness in the definition of cell types depend on gene detection cell sampling and noise estimates or statistical criteria39 (extended data fig 14b f).enzymatic digestion trituration into single cell suspension and facs analysis of single cells were carried out as previously described20 with example sorting strategy shown in extended data fig 1e–g.the descores used for extended data fig 14f are: 80 low stringency; 150 standard; and 300 high stringency.figure 3 and extended data fig 10 were generated based on this dataset.the classification probabilities by random forest strongly correlated with the gradient eigengene (extended data fig 14d).finally we split the l4–it–visp–rspo1 cells into five bins based on random forest classification probabilities and computed the differentially expressed genes between the two bins at the both ends of the gradient and the bin at the middle of the gradient (extended data fig 14d).article research

Reference sentences:[to compare atherosclerosis progression with regression mice in the progression groups were kept on wd for an additional 2 weeks whereas mice in the regression groups were switched to chow and treated with apob-aso for 2 weeks to lower plasma ldl levels (supplemental figure 2a).we then performed facs analysis to characterize tdtomato+ cells from aortas (supplemental figure 2b).while the overall number of tdtomato+ cells from aortas of mice undergoing progression and regression was not significantly different (supplemental figure 2c) there were phenotypic differences between the fate-mapped cells from the progression and regression groups as visualized by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne) (figure 1c).to further define the molecular features associated with progression and regression in cells derived figure 2.this allowed us to focus on cells belonging to the myeloid lineage by excluding t cells nk cells b cells eosinophils and neutrophils in the dump gate (supplemental figure 2b).after data normalization louvain clustering of the aggregated data combined from the progression and regression groups identified 11 cell clusters which were visualized using multicore t-sne (figure 2 a and b).the majority of the louvain clusters are contiguous which suggests a spectrum of related macrophage activation states apart from the more distinct clusters 0 3 5 and 7 (figure 2a) (discussed below).cluster 1 included the largest number of cells from both the progression and regression groups at a relatively similar frequency indicating a common feature of atherosclerosis (figure 2c).folate receptor β (folr2) is the most differentially expressed gene in cluster 1 (herein referred to as “folr2hi macrophages”; figure 2d figure 3 and supplemental figure 3b).of special interest the transcriptional profile of the cells in cluster 4 is dominated (figure 2d figure 3 and supplemental figure 3b) by the expression of chemokines and cytokines (ccl4 cxcl2 ccl3 ccl2 tnf cxcl1 cxcl10 ccl5) and appears similar to a population described as “inflammatory macrophages” by cochain et al.clusters 6 and 9 are closely related to each other with each having similar frequencies of cells in the progression and regression groups (figure 2c).they share expression of cxcl16 atox1 cd72 glipr1 but cluster 9 cells also express at higher levels of trem2 cd9 lgals3 spp1 aldoa (figure 2d figure 3 and supplemental figure 3b).we next focused on the cells in the distinct clusters 0 (1%) 3 (5%) 5 (9%) and 10 (14%) that contained cx3cr1+ cells mostly from the progression group (figure 2c).cluster 5 in particular expressed a strong type 1 ifn signature including ifn regulatory factor 7 (irf7) and ifn-stimulated gene 15 (isg15) as well as myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (mnda) and ifn-induced transmembrane protein 3 (ifitm3) (herein referred to as “ifn signaturehi macrophages”) (figure 2d figure 3 and supplemental figure 4).however genes expressed in cluster 3 were surprising because retnla and ear2 are associated with exposure to type 2 cytokines such as il-4 (herein referred to as “retnlahiear2hi macrophages”) (figure 2d figure 3 and supplemental figure 4).this approach identified retnlahiear2hi macrophages as having a trajectory separate from the main group comprising the other cell clusters (figure 4 a and b) and these retnlahiear2hi macrophages were predominantly from progressing plaques (figure 2 c and d figure 3 and supplemental figure 4).it was striking that 3 of the distinct clusters of activated macrophages (dnase1l3hi macrophages retnlahiear2hi macrophages ifn signaturehi macrophages; figure 2a) were highly enriched in cells from progressing plaques (figure 2c) indicating that during progression macrophages become more differentiated and activated than during plaque regression.cluster 8 is an important contributor to regression (31%) and less so to progression (5%) (figure 2c).the heat shock protein (hsp) genes hspa1a and hspa1b were also differentially expressed in cluster 8 (figure 2 c and d figure 3 and supplemental figure 4) indicating a protective role for hsps in atherosclerosis regression (herein referred to as “hsphi macrophages”).genes with the largest-magnitude loading factors for pc1 (e.g. cd74 and mhcii molecules) were associated with cells in cluster 10 (figure 2d figure 3 and figure 4e) which contained cells more abundant in progression than in regression (herein referred to as “cd74himhciihi macrophages”).our first observation is supported in the simplest sense by identification of 4 cell clusters (dnase1l3hi retnlahiear2hi ifn signaturehi cd74himhciihi macrophages) enriched from progressing plaques versus 2 cell clusters (ebf1hicd79ahi hsphi macrophages) enriched from regressing plaques (figure 2c).while macrophages with m2 features (cell surface expression of pd-l2 and cd301 and increased mrc1 expression) were more abundant during regression (figure 1 d–f figure 2 and figure 3) a distinct cluster of macrophages (retnlahiear2hi macrophages) expressing m2 signature genes was present in figure 7.however this cell cluster is relatively rare (figure 2c) and the roles or fate of these proliferative tissue-resident monocytes remains to be elucidated.]

Reference sentences:[to study the intra-tumor heterogeneity of chromatin states we developed a high-throughput scchip-seq approach that combines droplet microfluidics with single-cell dna barcoding technologies (fig 1a and supplementary fig 1–4).human ramos (b cell) and jurkat (t cell) cells were processed separately (as shown in fig 1a) by using two independent sets of barcoded adapters and after ligation of the adapters in droplets the barcoded nucleosomes were pooled and immunoprecipitated.for both single-cell chromatin profiling experiments we identified by consensus clustering two stable clusters corresponding to each cell line (fig 1b and supplementary fig 8a) matching cell identity with a specificity of over 99.7% and 99.5% respectively for the h3k4me3 and h3k27me3 profiles.consensus clustering approaches (supplementary fig 10) showed that stromal cells stably grouped in three chromatin-based populations according to h3k27me3 profiling chrom_c1 chrom_c2 and chrom_c3 irrespectively of whether the pdx was sensitive or resistant to treatment (fig 2b) thus arguing against a potential batch effect.by comparing chromatin features between groups of cells (supplementary fig 11) we identified loci with specific h3k27me3 enrichment for chrom_c2 and chrom_c3 populations (n = 1581 and n = 1282 respectively with adjusted p < 0.01 and absolute log2 fold change > 1; supplementary table 1) and to a lesser extent for cluster chrom_c1 (n = 122).in parallel scrna-seq analysis identified four populations of stromal cells (fig 2c and supplementary fig 12): two groups of cells of fibroblast origin (with the specific markers col12a1 and efemp1); endothelial cells (pecam1); and macrophage cells (ms4a7).b t-sne representation of scchip-seq datasets colored according to tumor of origin (sensitive or resistant to capecitabine left panel) or consensus clustering results (supplementary fig 10g).c t-sne representation of scrna-seq datasets colored according to tumor of origin or consensus clustering results (supplementary fig 12b).marker genes identified by differential expression analysis are indicated for each subpopulation (supplementary fig 12c).loci specifically devoid of h3k27me3 in cells from chrom_c2 that is permissive for transcription only in chrom_c2 were significantly enriched in genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (adjusted p = 2.8 × 10−3) such as col4a1 (supplementary fig 11b) or in apical junction (adjusted p = 9.0 × 10−2) such as ptk2 (fig 2d) both signatures being characteristic of fibroblast expression programs.similarly we found loci devoid of h3k27me3 specific to chrom_c3 enriched in genes from immune expression programs (adjusted p = 5.2 × 10−2; supplementary fig 11a) such as lrmp (fig 2e).bc t-sne representation of the scchip-seq datasets; cells are colored according to the tumor of origin (b) and consensus clustering segmentation (c) (supplementary fig 13c).we removed from the analysis loci affected by copy number variations as identified from bulk dna profiles to focus on chromatin alterations (supplementary fig 13a).based on both chromatin and transcriptomic profiles cells clustered primarily according to their sensitive or resistant tumor origin (fig 3a–c and supplementary fig 13bc).b t-sne representation of the scchip-seq datasets;

supplementary fig 14ab).however 16% (n = 41 out of 255) of cells within the sensitive tumor shared chromatin features with all resistant cells (fig 4a–c and supplementary fig 14c).differential analysis of chromatin features revealed that resistant-like and resistant cells (chrom_c2) have predominantly lost h3k27me3 marks compared to sensitive-like cells (supplementary fig 14d; n = 356 loci with depleted versus 137 with enriched h3k27me3 supplementary table 3).loci specifically devoid of h3k27me3 in cells from chrom_c2 were enriched in gene targets of the polycomb complex and genes of basal-like signatures of the mammary epithelium (supplementary fig 14e).with scrna-seq we could only detect transcription in 2% of differentially enriched windows and significant differential expression for three genes all showing transcription activation in a fraction of resistant cells mirroring their loss of h3k27me3 enrichment: egfr a gene implicated in resistance to tamoxifen2526; igfbp3; and alcam (fig 4dhi and supplementary fig 14g).parallel scrna-seq analysis of the same cell suspension identified several clusters within the resistant and sensitive tumor (fig 4ef and supplementary fig 14f).the overall workflow is shown in supplementary fig 1.we combined coverage matrices for each of our four analyses from the following samples: (1) ramos and jurkat (fig 1);

Reference sentences:[to define the transcriptional program executed by normal human cells undergoing emt we devised an in vitro system in which cells from an epithelial colony migrate into unoccupied margins of the plate (fig 1a).cells at the periphery of the patch acquired a spindle-like morphology and formed leading and protruding edges consistent with the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype (supplementary fig 1).cells collected from a single well of our assay expressed levels of e-cadherin and vimentin protein spanning a dynamic range that included those cultured at low or high confluence (supplementary fig 1cd).inner and outer fractions were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and subjected to scrna-seq on the 10x chromium platform (fig 1a and supplementary table 1).unsupervised clustering with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne) separated cells from inner and outer fractions (fig 1b) and expression of the mesenchymal marker vim varied in a reciprocal gradient to the epithelial markers cdh1 and dsp across embedded cells (fig 1c and supplementary fig 2).protein and messenger rna levels of the epithelial marker e-cadherin (cdh1) decreased as cells radiated from the center of the colony and over the pseudospatial trajectory consistent with a spontaneous spatially determined emt (fig 1ef).conversely mrna levels of vim increased sharply in cells in the second half of the trajectory (fig 1f).cluster 5 highly expressed in the outermost regions of the pseudospatial trajectory was associated with the regulation of the cell cycle consistent with the relief of contact-mediated inhibition of proliferation (fig 1gh and supplementary table 4).the emt-associated cluster 6 included the unfolded protein response (upr) transcriptional regulator atf4 whose increased expression preceded upregulation of genes in cluster 5 which was enriched for genes associated with the upr (cluster 5 and 6 fig 1gh and supplementary fig 8) consistent with a recent study demonstrating that the induction of emt elicits protective activation of the upr32.the dynamics of epithelial and mesenchymal marker expression was comparable albeit with decreased cdh1 downregulation and more drastic upregulation of fn1 (fig 1i and supplementary fig 9c).we sequenced transcriptomes of 2121 inner and 2116 outer colony cells that were segregated in t-sne space but did not form coherent clusters and whose expressed fn1 and vim continuously varied (supplementary fig 10).we therefore constructed a pseudospatial trajectory for tgf-β as well (supplementary fig 11).exposure of humec cells to tgf-β similarly led to a robust increase in vim and fn1 at the beginning of the trajectory (supplementary fig 12c); however expression of cdh2 was not apparent.a broader geneset analysis comparing normalized average expression scores41 showed that tgf-β drove msigdb hallmark emt genes higher and gene ontology biological process epidermis development genes lower in both mcf10a and humec cells (supplementary fig 13).this analysis identified 1328 genes in 10 clusters with distinct tgf-β-dependent dynamics (fig 2c likelihood ratio test; fdr < 1 × 10−10 and |δauc| > 0.02 see methods supplementary fig 14 and supplementary table 6).conversely cluster 10 included epithelial marker genes downregulated early in spontaneous emt and expressed at low levels in cells treated with tgf-β (for example krt4 and krt16) (supplementary fig 16).the most mesenchymal tumor as ranked by puram et al15. expressed emt genes at similar levels to cells at the outer end of our tgf-β-driven pseudospatial trajectory (supplementary fig 17).for three of the four tumors with sufficient cells for monocle analysis the algorithm recovered a linear trajectory (supplementary fig 18) with similar expression kinetics to in vitro trajectories (supplementary fig 18).unsupervised clustering analysis of cells treated with tgf-β identified prominent clearly demarcated clusters of cells that retained expression of the epithelial markers cdh1 and crb3 and failed to upregulate fn1 and vim (fig 3c and supplementary fig 19ab).cells expressing sgrnas targeting tgfbr1 and tgfbr2 were enriched in these clusters (fisher’s exact test; fdr < 1 × 10−50) (fig 3de and supplementary fig 19c) while ntc sgrnas were largely absent from them.for pseudospatial experiments in the absence or presence of tgf-β presented in fig 1 and 2 2000–3000 cells were captured on the chromium platform (10x genomics) using one lane per fraction.the compare_means function from the ggpubr package was used to determine the significance in changes in scores between endpoints in mcf10a and humec emt trajectories (supplementary fig 13) specifying the wilcox.test as the method and using the holm procedure (holm) to correct for multiple hypothesis testing.]

(a) representative images of embryonic day 11.5 (e11.5) submandibular and e12 parotid epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. the epithelia of the 2 glands at this early developmental stage are morphologically similar, with round evaginating epithelial buds. in contrast, morphologic differences can be observed between the mesenchymal tissues, with the submandibular mesenchyme being denser and more well defined. (b) principal component analysis based on the top 500 most variable genes detected with bulk rna-seq. principal component analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique that represents the global expression profiles of different samples in a 2-dimensional space. principal component 1 separated samples according to differential gene expression between epithelial and mesenchymal tissues, while principal component 2 separated the gene expression patterns of submandibular and parotid glands, with much greater separation between the mesenchymal samples as compared with the epithelial counterparts. this finding indicates greater transcriptional heterogeneity between mesenchymal tissues as compared with epithelial tissues of the 2 glands.

Keyword: [clustering]. Caption: ['fig 4a). scenic defines the regulon as an ensemble of genes coregulated by a single transcription factor and determines the regulon(s) active in single cells in three steps. first, covariation of the expression levels of the genes is estimated in the single-cell dataset. then, each group of genes displaying covariation is screened for common cis-regulatory motifs present in the group. this defines groups of genes regulated by a specific transcription factor (=regulon). finally, the activity of each regulon is estimated in each cell of the dataset (aibar et al, 2017). of note, this analysis was done independently of our initial clustering based on the expression levels. the clustering of the wt ni cells based on the regulons is highly comparable to the expression-based clustering, with a high overlap between the two clustering approaches, as estimated by the rand index or ri (rand, 1971; ri = 0.83; see the materials and methods section). this overlap highlights the robustness of our initial clustering. the scenic analysis allowed us to associate specific regulons to each cluster (fig 4a). concordant with previous reports, the analysis highlighted a positive correlation between the regulon lz and the crystal cells. lz is a runx transcription factor essential for the differentiation of these cells (lebestky et al, 2000). the pl-rel, plamp, and pl-vir1 clusters are characterized by the regulons jra (jnk cascade), rel (imd pathway), and ets21c (which cooperates with the jnk pathway). the regulon activating transcription factor 3 (atf3) involved in anti-viral response in mammals (labzin et al, 2015) is specific to pl-vir1 and pl-rel, whereas the regulon creba regulating the secretory pathway is specific to the pl-amp cluster, which expresses most of the antimicrobial peptides. the pl-prolif cluster and the closely related cluster pl-inos (fig 4b) are enriched for the regulons ecr and e2f1 that are involved in the regulation of hemocyte proliferation (sinenko et al, 2010). pl-lsp is associated with the tbp regulon that is involved in the canonical transcriptional machinery. such enrichment may indicate a higher rate of transcription, which would be concordant with the function of this cluster in producing storage proteins in preparation for pupariation. pl-robo2 is enriched for the regulons of the gata factors pnr and srp, which is known to regulate the expression of scavenger receptors in the hemocytes (shlyakhover et al, 2018; valanne et al, 2018). at last, pl-impl2 is enriched in ham, kn, cg9609, and nf-yb. ham was shown to limit amplifying divisions in neural stem cells (eroglu et al, 2014). cg9609 is a zinc finger transcription factor poorly described, expressed mostly in ovaries (robinson et al, 2013), and nf-yb regulates cell death and proliferation (ly et al, 2013).'].

Reference sentences:[upon scree plot inspection of pca eigenvalues contributions we selected the first 10 principal components for clustering and tsne visualization (supplemental figure 10(a)).robustness of our clustering results in data normalization scaling and detection of variable genes was confirmed by reanalysis using seurat 3 sctransform16 (supplemental figure 10(b)).to evaluate associations (overlap) between cluster signatures and reference signatures (figure 1(e) and supplemental figure 1) for each pair of cell cluster signature genes and reference signatures contingency tables were calculated by counting how many genes among all expressed genes (15337) are present or absent in the cluster or the reference signature and then one-sided fisher’s exact test with fdr adjustment for multiple testing was used to calculate statistical significance of associations.we individually analyzed four wild-type (wt) c57bl/6 mice and three pmel transgenic mice whose cd8 t cells express a transgenic tcr specific for the b16 tumor-associated antigen gp100/pmel on a c57bl/6 genetic background (figure 1(a)).gzmb prf1 fasl) compatible with an exhausted state (figure 1(bc)).tcf7 lef1 sell) and low levels of cytotoxicity genes (figure 1(bc)) compatible with the recently described memory-like subset.67 cluster 3 (c3) was defined by high expression of markers of naïve/memory (e.g.tcf7 sell ccr7 lef1 il7r) and no expression of cytotoxicity genes or inhibitory receptors compatible with a naïve or central memory state (figure 1(bc)).based on the lack of cd44 expression in this cluster (figure 1(c)) we provisionally refer to it as naïve cells cluster.compared to the memory-like c2 c4 was characterized by low expression of the inhibitory receptors pdcd1 tigit lag3 and the exhaustion-related transcription factors tox and batf (figure 1(c)).expression of granzymes and lack of sell and ccr7 expression suggested an effector memory rather than a central memory phenotype (figure 1(c)).hence this cluster was referred to as effector memory-like (“em-like”) state (figure 1(bc)).while the naïve cluster (c3) presented the highest level of stemness and the lowest inhibition and cytotoxicity the exhausted cluster (c1) presented the lowest levels of stemness with the highest levels of inhibition and cytotoxicity (figure 1(d)).the memory-like (c2) cluster displayed higher levels of “stemness” compared to exhausted together with lower levels of inhibition and very low levels of cytotoxicity in line with previous observations.67 instead the em-like (c4) cluster displayed intermediate levels of cytotoxicity and “stemness” with low levels of inhibition (figure 1(d)).an initial gene-signature enrichment analysis confirmed that c3 matched the transcriptomic state of splenic naïve t cells19 while the other three clusters up-regulated genes associated with differentiated cd8 t cells (supplemental figure 1 see methods).we found a consistent mapping of the memory-like (c2) cluster with the tumor-resident pd-1+ tcf1+ “memory-like” subset7 (figure 1(e)) whereas the exhausted cluster (c1) was mapped to the “exhausted” pd-1+ tcf1− subset described in the same study.further these two clusters also matched the memory-like and exhausted subsets respectively found in chronic infection11 (figure 1(e)).the em-like cluster did not match the exhausted nor the memory-like signatures and instead showed specific enrichment for the signature of pathogen-specific cd8 t cells found upon acute infection (“tumor vs acute infection – down” row 6 in figure 1 (e)).20 further among pathogenspecific cd8 t cells found upon acute infection the em-like cluster was specifically enriched in the signature of memory (day 60 post lcmv armstrong infection “memory vs effector (acute inf.)– down”) (rows 7 and 8 in figure 1 (e)).differential gene expression analysis of em-like vs exhausted and memory-like cells revealed potential novel markers for this population (figure 1(f)) including ly6c2 that encodes a surface molecule that has been previously associated to memory cd8 t cells48-50 and cxcr3 a chemokine receptor that guides the recruitment of t cells into inflamed peripheral tissue.51 oncoimmunology e1737369-7 next we analyzed how cd8 til states were distributed among and within wt and pmel mice.we found that t cells from all mice were present in all four states (figure 1(g) supplemental figure 2 and supplemental table 2) although a clear distribution bias was observed between wt and pmel mice (i.e.with high expression of cell cycle-related genes) were detected within exhausted (16%) memory-like (6%) and em-like (4%) states (cells in magenta in figure 1 (b–h) left panel) as opposed to cells from the naïve cluster that did not cycle (<1%).when considering pmel-specific t cells (effectively expressing pmel tcr receptor see methods) a similar distribution was observed (figure 1(h) right panel).from our transcriptomics data em-like cells were predicted to be in the tcf1high pd-1int compartment (figure 2(a)) and to display high levels of ly6c2 cxcr3 and itgb7 (figure 1(f)).exhausted memory-like and em-like cd8 tils are clonally expanded and show partial clonal relatedness in order to assess the clonal relatedness of cd8 til states we analyzed t cell receptors' alpha and beta chain sequences in the >3500 single-cells shown in figure 1(b) (see methods).a likely explanation is that the em-like compartment is enriched in nontumor-specific cells as multiple studies have shown the presence of large numbers of “bystander” t cells in human tumors.6162 however the presence of tumor-specific pmel t cells in the em-like state (figure 1(g) and supplemental figure 2) as well as the clonal expansion and partial tcr repertoire overlap between the em-like and exhausted states (figure 3(d) and supplemental figure 6 d) indicates that at least part of the em-like population is indeed tumor-specific.]

Reference sentences:[despite the lower amount of cells the individual analysis of each sample generated a similar number of clusters and identified the same major cell types (supplementary fig 2).since it is well established that skin and its fibroblasts undergo specific changes upon aging34–36 we only used the expression profiles of the fibroblasts from young samples (1792 cells) for this analysis (fig 2a and supplementary data 2).go analyses also assigned mesenchymal functions such as skeletal system development ossification or osteoblast differentiation to the cells belonging to clusters #3 or #9 (fig 2b).significant examples include inﬂammatory response cell chemotaxis or negative regulation of cell proliferation necessary for the final anchoring of leukocytes (fig 2b).the analysis also revealed that the collagen genes col11a1 and col24a1 associated with cartilage and bone development3839 respectively were specifically expressed in the fibroblasts of cluster #9 (fig 2c) suggesting a stronger mesenchymal component for this cell subpopulation.for the remaining collagen and ecm secreting clusters (#1 and #3) the data showed a bias in the production of collagens that have previously been linked to specific dermal locations (fig 2c).in agreement with the collagen expression data our results showed that the papillary gene expression signature is mostly restricted to fibroblasts in cluster #3 (fig 2d).in contrast fibroblasts in clusters #1 #2 and #9 showed more prominent expression of the reticular signature with the highest reticular (and lowest papillary) expression levels observed in cluster #1 (fig 2d).in relative terms our results suggest an apparent reduction in the number of mesenchymal fibroblasts in the old samples (fig 2a and 4a).]

Reference sentences:[in this study using the same combination of transcription factors we defined the analogous effector subsets in mait cells designated as mait1 mait2 and mait17 and in γδ t cells designated as tγδ1 tγδ2 and tγδ17 cells (fig 1a).however we found that plzfhi type 2 subsets of mait and γδ t cells were relatively enriched at stage 2 compared to type 1 or type 17 cells (supplementary fig 1a).cytokine profiles of these subsets closely reﬂected their transcription factor expressions and type 1 type 2 and type 17 cells secreted ifn-γ il-4 and il-17 respectively upon activation (supplementary fig 1b c).as previously showed cd44low and cd44hi nkt2 cells produced il-416 and this feature was also found in mait and γδ t cells (supplementary fig 1d).we further analyzed the expression patterns of nine lineage specific markers and performed hierarchical clustering which grouped together analogous effector subsets of nkt mait and γδ t cells (fig 1b).however each vγ chain generated multiple tγδ subsets with age-related variations (supplementary fig 1e f) and we tested if tγδ subsets have transcriptional similarities with those of inkt cells (fig 1c–e).for this we sorted γδ25+ tγδ1 tγδ2 and tγδ17 cells using surface markers as in fig 1b and performed bulk rna-seq analysis (supplementary fig 2a–c).for the analysis we first defined 200–435 differentially expressed genes (degs) in each subset and listed cytokines receptors and transcription factors in heat maps (fig 1c).when we performed principal component analysis (pca) on 18064 genes the four subsets were distinctly separated by two principal components accounting for 85% of the total variance (fig 1d) indicating they are distinct entities.finally pca on the 120 functional genes using six different subsets from inkt and γδ t cells showed that their transcriptional profiles were grouped according to their cytokines receptors and transcription factors rather than their antigen receptors (fig 1e).we additionally found that thymi of tcrd−/− mice contained three times more mait cells (fig 1f) indicating that not only nkt cells but also γδ t cells suppress the development of mait cells.in γδ t cells we obtained seven clusters (g1–g7) as annotated in supplementary fig 10a b.we subdivided g6 into g6-1 and g6-2 according to their usage of trgv4 and trgv6 as the latter is known to originate from fetal thymus25 (supplementary fig 10d e).genes including pdcd1 cxcr6 zbtb16 and cd44 distinguished vγ6+ (g6-2) from vγ4+ (g6-1) γδ t cells and we validated these results by ﬂow cytometry (supplementary fig 10e).g7 cells included a small fraction of tbx21+ tγδ1 cells and we separated them as g7-2 for mature tγδ1 and other cells as g7-1 for immature tγδ1 (tγδ1i) cells (supplementary fig 10c f).because we have used only female mait cells we further validated that male and female mait cells have no transcriptional difference using previous dataset that used both male and female mice (personal communication with dr. lantz supplementary fig 11) overall the type 1 and 17 effector subsets of inkt mait and γδ t cells were clustered together in the umap analysis (fig 2d) further supporting their developmental similarities and we defined their precursors in scrna-seq analysis.we further analyzed the potential precursor–progeny relationships between subpopulations of mait and γδ t cells by deriving a pseudo-temporal ordering of cells along differentiation trajectories using palantir (fig 3) and monocle 3 (supplementary fig 12).m6 and m7 were localized close to nktp in combined umap (fig 2d) and they shared their signature genes with nktp (n1) (fig 3c and supplementary fig 13) indicating they are immature mait17 (mait17i) cells.although m2 mait cells did not co-localize with nkt2 cells in combined umap analysis (fig 2d middle panels) they shared their signature genes mainly with nkt2 cells (fig 3c and supplementary fig 13) suggesting that m2 corresponds to mait2 cells that we identified in ﬂow cytometry (fig 1a).based on this trajectory we annotated g1 as the most immature precursors of γδ t cells (tγδp) g2 and g3 as common precursors of tγδ1 and tγδ17 cells (immature tγδ1/17 or tγδ1/17i) g4 and g5 as tγδ17i cells (fig 3b and supplementary fig 10a–c).the signature gene set of γδ25+ cells and cd25 was rather highly expressed in g2 (supplementary fig 10a–c h) suggesting tγδp (g1) cells are earlier precursors than γδ25+ cells.next we analyzed the clonal repeats of innate t cells and surprisingly found they have highly oligoclonal repeats (fig 4b–d and supplementary fig 15 and supplementary data 2).although four γδ tcr clonotypes repeated more than 50 times the pattern of cumulative clonal repeat of γδ t cells was similar to that of inkt cells which were less than that of mait cells (fig 4c and supplementary fig 15).interestingly mait cells had less clonotypic repeat (fig 4b and supplementary fig 15) or overlap between clusters (supplementary fig 8d 9c and 10g) compared to nkt and γδ t cells.however this is unlikely as we and others observed a substantial level of ki-67 expressions at least in stage 2 and 3 mait cells29 (supplementary fig 16a) and cell cycle-regulated genes as well as lineage specific signatures were upregulated during maturation (supplementary fig 17 and supplementary table 2).it is also unlikely that each mouse had unique clonal repeat because when we separated two biological replicates of mait cells (eight mice each) there was more reduction in their clonal repeat (supplementary fig 16b).we also observed similar trends when we analyzed all different combinations of non-canonical tcrα and/or non-oligoclonal tcrβ usages (supplementary fig 18a).to further rule out the possibility of cell contamination we analyzed signature gene expression patterns between mait cells with canonical and noncanonical tcrα in each cluster using defined gene sets produced from previous research29 and found that there were few deg between them except their tcrs (supplementary fig 18b).in contrast we found 55–430 degs between canonical maits and cd4+cd8+ dp thymocytes that we excluded from analysis as in supplementary fig 6a (supplementary fig 18d).first there was no proportional expansion of other minor tγδ17 cells (vγ5 and vγ7 fig 5c pie chart) and second ki-67 levels of vγ1+vδ6.3+ cells were not increased in vγ4/6 ko mice (supplementary fig 19a).third the frequency of vγ1+vδ6.3+ cells among tγδ2 cells was decreased in vγ4/6 ko mice (supplementary fig 19b) suggesting some of them redirected their fate from tγδ2 cells to tγδ17 cells at the progenitor stage.γδ t cells are mostly double negative and cd4 expression was limited to tγδ2 cells (fig 1b) and they were efficiently depleted in gata3 cko mice (fig 6a).in this study we newly defined mait2 cells that correspond to nkt2 or tγδ2 cells (fig 1a).unlike nkt2 or tγδ2 cells however mait2 cells did not express il17rb (fig 1b) were less efficient for il-4 production (supplementary fig 1b c) and were not co-localized with nkt2 cells in umap (fig 2d).however m2 (mait2) had similarity with n3 (nkt2) and n1 (nktp) was more likely m6 (mait17i) in their transcriptional nature (fig 3c and supplementary fig 13).consistent with this we also found rorc+ccr6+sox13+ cells present in most immature g1 cluster (supplementary fig 10c).]

Reference sentences:[alternative induced pluripotent conditions to further characterize the cell populations that arise during reprogramming we performed an unsupervised clustering analysis20 which identified 21 cell clusters (extended data fig 2a).the clusters enabled us to apply partition-based graph abstraction (paga)21 trajectory inference which confirmed that the primed-reprogramming and naive-reprogramming trajectories bifurcate (fig 1f extended data fig 2b–d).furthermore the mesenchymal– epithelial transition occurred early during reprogramming (extended data fig 2e).we performed a differential gene-expression analysis to identify cluster-specific marker genes which were then combined to produce eight gene signatures (extended data fig 2f–h supplementary table 3); two of these signatures robustly distinguished primed from naive ips cells.day-13 and day-21 intermediates from rset medium transitioned along the naive t2ilgoy trajectory but ultimately switched branches which established the fact that ips cells cultured in rset (at passages 3 and 10) clustered near primed ips cells (fig 2a extended data fig 3f supplementary table 4).these observations were confirmed by scoring these reprogramming intermediates using the primed and naive gene signatures (fig 2b extended data fig 3g supplementary table 5).pca of the atac-seq peaks (fig 2c extended data fig 5a) and the integration of this analysis with the corresponding rna-seq experiments (extended data fig 5b c methods) revealed distinct changes in chromatin accessibility and a bifurcated trajectory as observed in our transcriptional analyses.to uncover the distinct dynamics of chromatin accessibility we performed fuzzy clustering23 which resulted in eight clusters (which we labelled c1–c8) (supplementary table 7) that we grouped by their behaviour over time (fig 2d).two clusters (c7 and c8) show an unexpected significant (supplementary table 9) motif enrichment of te-associated transcription factors (for example tfap2c and gata2) and these transcription factors were specifically upregulated during reprogramming to the naive state or transiently upregulated in the primed state (as for example in c7) (fig 2e extended data fig 6d–f).furthermore the shared-up c5 also exhibited enrichment for these same factors (fig 2e).although the absence of tfap2c had a minor effect on the efficiency of primed reprogramming naive reprogramming was greatly impaired (fig 2f).the fact that the knockdown of the transcription factors that are predicted to drive these networks impaired naive reprogramming (fig 2) suggests that both sub-branches are active and that the reprogramming trajectories remain similar for different naive conditions (5ilaf and t2ilgoy).furthermore the upregulation of te-associated transcriptional networks during reprogramming into the epiblast-like state (naive) is unexpected (fig 2e 3a) as one of the first cell-fate decisions that cells make during development is whether they will become trophoblast or epiblast.colony counts of tfap2c and gata2 knockdown experiments are provided in source data for fig 2f.before differential expression we performed clustering on only the snrna-seq using the procedure described in ‘scrna-seq and snrna-seq cell clustering’ (using the top 12 pcs instead of the top 14 pcs) generating 21 snrna clusters (extended data fig 2d).hierarchical clustering was then performed on the jaccard similarity of the marker genes (extended data fig 2f) to identify overlapping gene sets that is the gene signatures.this was then used to track the cell identity changes during reprogramming (extended data fig 2i).detailed cell numbers for snrna-seq and scrna-seq in each figure are as follows: fig 1b extended data fig 1e–gk–r 43791 cells across 17 libraries (3713 d0-fm cells 3511 d4-fm cells 3809 d8-fm cells 2472 d12-pr cells 491 d12-nr cells 4506 d16-pr cells 2578 d16-nr cells 2680 d20-pr cells 1858 d20-nr cells 2148 d24-pr cells 1121 d24-nr cells 2169 p3-nr cells 3009 p20-pr cells 2532 p20-nr cells 2402 fm cells 2506 primed reprogramming cells and 2286 naive reprogramming cells);

Reference sentences:[figure 1 details the workﬂow and the design of this study which included a discovery dataset of single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) from microglia (fig 1a) based on which we define the basic population structure of microglia in situ confirmation of our findings (fig 1b) and independent replication of our observation in two independent datasets (fig 1c d).the extracted live immune cells from these autopsy and surgery samples primarily consist of myeloid cells (supplementary fig 1a) and we observed the presence of rare non-myeloid immune cells in some of the samples (supplementary fig 1b).these non-myeloid cells were collected to serve as a positive control for our experimental and computational pipeline’s ability to resolve different cell types (supplementary fig 1; see supplementary data 1 for sorting gate used with each sample).importantly neither the modified gating strategy to include the peripheral immune cells nor the different cell sorters affected the basic population structure of microglia (supplementary fig 1c–g).(fig 8a b supplementary fig 10 and supplementary data 10).on the other hand peripheral myeloid cluster 10 also shows a mixed series of association with amyloid pathology as well as inﬂammatory and proliferative diseases (supplementary fig 11a).we also see that many individual gwas-identified risk genes for ad pd ms and als (supplementary fig 12a through d respectively) are expressed in most of the clusters and are not enriched in any particular microglial subset; however microglial cells belonging to cluster 4 and 7 do have a higher expression of some of the ad susceptibility genes such as apoe and trem2 respectively (supplementary fig 12a).further cluster 4 has a higher expression of ms susceptibility genes (such as ifitm3; supplementary fig 12c).interestingly the tspo gene the target for all current microglial markers used in positron emission tomography (pet) studies is at the rna level expressed in all clusters at a comparable level (supplementary fig 12e) and may therefore be a good proxy for total microglial count.on the other hand the monocyte cluster genes appear to be upregulated in relation to an increasing amyloid pathology burden (supplementary fig 11d).gene-set enrichment analysis (supplementary fig 12 and supplementary data 12) shows that m5 is widely expressed across microglial subtypes and does not align with any single microglial subset.adjusting for age and gender we find that subjects with ad (1) have a significant reduction in the frequency of iba1+ cd74high microglial cells in the frontal cortex (p = 0.0089; fig 8d) but (2) have no change in the number of total iba1 + cells (p = 0.30; supplementary fig 14a).as shown in supplementary fig 15d we did not find any association between the topological distribution of cluster 7 and amyloid plaques.the clusters are also found in single nucleus data (supplementary fig 14) consistent with the fact that our purification protocol does not appear to lose a specific microglial subtype.in particular antigen-presenting cluster 7 stands out amongst the other clusters since it emerges as enriched for ad genes that are diminished in expression at the cortical tissue level in both pathologically defined ad and ad dementia (fig 8c and supplementary fig 14b c).results for two different clusters are shown (cluster 4 and cluster 7); results for the other microglial clusters are included in supplementary fig 10.there is no difference in the frequency of iba1+ cells (supplementary fig 14a).the per individual proportions of each cluster is shown in supplementary fig 14b.subsequently the cell suspension was washed twice with staining buffer filtered through a 70 um filter and the cd11b+/cd45+/7aadcells or cd45+/7aadcells (fig 1a supplementary fig 1 and supplementary data 1) were sorted on a bd facs aria ii or inﬂux cell sorter.using these cluster-specific gene lists we performed disease ontology analyses using the dose r package26 with standard parameters and benjamini–hochberg procedure (fig 8a b and supplementary fig 10 and 11a–c).we appended the single nuclei identified as microglia in that study to our clusters using canonical correlation analysis (cca)37 followed by mapping nuclei to our singlecell microglia clusters in cca space using a naïve bayes classifier (supplementary fig 14b).as expected the microglial clusters showed enrichment for a subset of modules known to be enriched for microglial signatures (supplementary fig 13 and supplementary data 12) whereas the non-microglial clusters showed much weaker associations.similar approach was used for assessing topological distribution of cluster 7 microglia (supplementary fig 15) as it relates to amyloid plaques.]

extended data fig 2b).paired-tag generated datasets with high mapping rates: >95% of h3k4me1 and h3k27ac; ~72% of h3k27me3; and >85% of h3k4me3 h3k9me3 and rna reads can be mapped to the reference genome with an estimated random barcode collision rate of ~8.2% (extended data fig 2cd).we recovered up to ~20000 unique loci mapped per nucleus for dna profiles (median number of unique loci per nucleus h3k4me1: 19332 and 17357; h3k4me3: 2571 and 2046; h3k27ac: 4460 and 4543; h3k27me3: 2565 and 2499; h3k9me3: 16404 and 18497 for frontal cortex and hippocampus respectively) and up to ~15000 unique molecular identifiers (umis) per nucleus for rna profiles with 85% of them assigned to genic regions (median numbers 14295 and 8185 umis corresponding to 2400 and 1855 genes for frontal cortex and hippocampus respectively) (fig 1c and extended data fig 2e–g).the histone modification profiles have a similar number of unique loci captured per nucleus as the recently developed combinatorial barcoding and targeted chromatin release (cobatch)17 and are higher than for single cell itchip (simultaneous indexing and tagmentation-based chip-seq)18 and high-throughput single-cell chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ht-scchip-seq)19 (extended data fig 2e).the capture efficiency of nuclear rna in paired-tag is also on par with other commonly used single cell rna-seq (scrna-seq) assays such as split-pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing (split-seq)34 and 10x scrna-seq (extended data fig 2g).after filtering out nuclei with low sequence coverage and removing potential doublets (methods) we recovered 64849 nuclei with matched dna and rna profiles (extended data fig 2h–k and supplementary table 2).compared with 10x scrna-seq paired-tag rna datasets have more reads mapped to genic regions and captured more intronic reads (extended data fig 2kl).we also clustered the paired-tag profiles based on datasets of different histone marks (fig 2 and methods).sixteen groups of h3k4me1-based and 12 of h3k27acbased clustering matched well with those from rna-based clustering (fig 2c).additionally rna-based clustering can further separate asc subgroups;
